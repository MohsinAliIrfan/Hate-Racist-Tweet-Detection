# Hate-Racist-Tweet-Detection
Hate/Racist Tweet Detection using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning 
Used 2 differernt datasets both of them based on different types of tweets.
Performed Data Analysis and Visualized the dataset for better understanding
Used different machine learning algorithms like svm, naive bayes, logistic regression, decision trees e.t.c.
Did Hyper parameter tuning for better performance of our models.
Used Streamlit library to develop a front end where user can enter a random tweet and see if it promotes racism or not.
